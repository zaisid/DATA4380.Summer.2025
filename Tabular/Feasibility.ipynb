    "For Wednesday June 25 you should be well on your way to assess feasibility of your project. This notebook will be submitted Friday June 27. You can find example codes in [Kaggle Lecture](https://github.com/UTA-DataScience/DATA3402.Spring.2025/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture.19/Lecture.19.ipynb) from Data 3402. You can find the recordings of a walk-through in our class Team (`Data 4380- 2024/Lecture Recordings`), Lectures 8 and 10-12.\n",
